I'm going to check the price every 5 seconds, and use price levels to decide when I execute market orders. The main reasoning for the short intervals is 
both long intervals and price levels are used to ignore rapid short-term movement and to confirm a movement. I also use market orders because (1) specifying
a certain price to buy/sell can potentially not fill successfully and (2) if i use stop prices, I will be highly subject to fluctuations around a certain
price level. Since I check every 5 seconds, I will not have to worry about, for example, not buying the same value of an asset as I sold it. Again, fluctations
may kill me, but I think the general move upwards will make up for the loss enough for a profit. 

So although the gap levels are supposed to confirm movements, checking every 5 seconds still kills me when it 
comes to fluctuations. I can solve this by two ways: (1) To increase the waiting time to more than 5 seconds
or (2) to sell it at a price a little less than the sell price or to buy it at a price a little more than the buy price.
I think that both can be implemented, but let's try only (1) first. 

Another problem is that I'm getting rounded out into oblivion. So when I sell, I should instead sell all the currency.

Now, I've increased the price check interval to 3 minutes so that small fluctations don't kill me. I've also incrased the gap to lower the chances of being 
caught in a sideways market. The price levels no longer change to the market order price and remain the same. 

Another less aggressive and safer approach is to not "chase" the falling price. This program would only update the selling price level and would not touch the 
buying price level. This would reduce the chances of being caught in fluctuations and reduce loss from fees and market order spreads. However, it wouldn't be 
good at catching discounts.
